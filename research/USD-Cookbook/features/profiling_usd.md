This section will hopfully get expanded upon in the future. But
basically, USD doesn't have a lot of facilities to do profiling right
now.

The best you've got is 
[UsdUtilsComputeUsdStageStats](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/api/introspection_8h.html#a06bc3306d91684cc70b2b6e3768ca3f7).

Apparently there's also a memory footprint tagging system but I couldn't
get it to work and apparently it's not working currently.

There's a brief section on [enable debugging C++ project](../concepts/enable_debugging/cpp/main.cpp)
but again, it's pretty bare-minimum.
