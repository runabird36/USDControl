## Quick Summary

This section summarizes an example of the `specializes` Composition Arc.
The code is taken straight from the USD Glossary. I made this section
mainly as a reminder to myself that `specializes` is only particularly
interesting once it has been included in another Layer (what the USD
Glossary calls "it's referencing context").
